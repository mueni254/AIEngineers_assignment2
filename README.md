##ðŸš— EV Charging Station Availability Predictor (Supervised Learning)

This project builds a simple machine learning model that recommends the best EV charging station based on:
Charging slots availability,
Distance to station
Time of day and day of week
Vehicle type
Weather temperature


We simulate user and station data, train a regression model to predict the number of available charging slots, and recommend the best station based on predicted availability and proximity.
This is one feature of a proposed mobile app that recommends charging stations to Electric Vehicles. 


âœ… What the Notebook Does
Simulates training data
 Randomly generates 500 data points with distance, time, weather, and vehicle type.
Trains a model
 Uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict number of available slots.
Predicts and recommends
 Given a userâ€™s location and context, predicts station availability and recommends the best options.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Supervised learning (regression)
Feature encoding for categorical data
Distance calculation using geodesic coordinates
Prediction-based station ranking

ðŸ”§ Requirements
All libraries are included in Google Colab:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
geopy


ðŸš€ How to Use
Run script in order to simulate data, train the model, and view recommendations
Update user location or station list to test various scenarios
